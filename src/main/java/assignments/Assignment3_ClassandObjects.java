//Create an Employees class that stores the following employee names and IDs in separate variables:• Employee Names: "Bharath", "ABC", "XYZ"

	//Retrieve the data from the Employees class, store it in these arrays, and finally print each employee's
	//name along with their corresponding ID.
	//Example:
	//• Employee Name: Bharath, Employee ID: 1234
	String Emp1="Bharat",Emp2="ABC",Emp3="XYZ";
